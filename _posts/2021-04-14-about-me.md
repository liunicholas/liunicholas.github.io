### In my freshmen year of high school, my computer science teacher told my friend and I that comments would be optional for the final project. We only had 2 weeks to essentially create a fully functioning browser arcade.


**craziest thing I've done:** [rapping a minecraft parody in front of over 300 people in an auditorium at UCSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp58u_Tlv38)

**hobbies:** 3D CAD design and printing, desk organization, watching and reading F1 technical analysis (favorite driver is Kimi <3)
