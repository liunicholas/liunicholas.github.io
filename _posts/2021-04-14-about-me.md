### In my freshmen year of high school, we only had 2 weeks to essentially create a fully functioning browser arcade[^1] for the final project of the comp sci class. Fortunately, the teacher told my friend and I that comments would be optional so that we could finish in time. Unfortunately, when I went back to look at my code, I understand practically none of it.
<br>
### In order to avoid such a mishap with my own life memories, I decided to document as much of the relevant parts of my life as possible on this website. During this pandemic, I've frequently had existential crises on what I've ever done in life. This should help me remember.
<br>
### Additionally, for anyone looking to learn about me as a person, to read about my crazy comp sci projects, or to see me rap a minecraft song[^2], I urge them to explore my site :)

**craziest thing I've done:** [rapping a minecraft parody in front of over 300 people in an auditorium at UCSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp58u_Tlv38)

**hobbies:** 3D CAD design and printing, desk organization, watching and reading F1 technical analysis (favorite driver is Kimi <3)
