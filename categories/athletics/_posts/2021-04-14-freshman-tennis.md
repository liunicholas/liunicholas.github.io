#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my freshman year, I was fortunate enough to play singles in varsity tennis for The Bishop's School. My playstyle at the time (and arguably now) is just pushing the ball and not making mistakes, which allowed me to have a pretty consistent game. I ended the season with about 30 wins and 5 losses. In the CIF individuals matches, I pulled off an insane comeback after being done 2-5 in the first set but had to withdraw due to injury.
