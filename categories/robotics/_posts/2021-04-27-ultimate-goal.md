#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was probably the most awkward FTC season. After the previous season was ended abruptly by the pandemic, our team redirected our time and effort to building and distributing face shields to frontline healthcare workers around the nation. Additionally, our annual FLL summer camp was cancelled aso we instead tought an online Zoom CAD class.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of Covid, the garage was restricted to 3-5 people per build session. I was spending about a third of the time I usually spent in the garage. To make up for it, I coded an algorithm that calculates the optimal angle of the shooter to hit the high goal target and also did the video editing for presentations at home. 
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that next year when everyone is in person again, I get to spend more time on robotics.
