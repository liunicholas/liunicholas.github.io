#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last season we came off of a high, and I feel like our whole team really matured together. For our fourth season, we set out to reach the World Championships again but we also wanted to be a little more relaxed and have more fun.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We traveled to Arizona and won the state qualifiers, we went to Stanford's robotics laboratory and Google's AI department, and we all truly had a blast designing and building the robot. This season was the epitome of why I love FTC robotics.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we did qualify for the World Championships in Houston, the global pandemic shut it down. With our extra time and resources, we contributed to the efforts in 3D printing face shields for frontline healthcare workers.
