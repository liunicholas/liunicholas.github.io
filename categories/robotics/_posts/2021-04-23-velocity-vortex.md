#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Velocity Vortex was my rookie season of FTC. With several other teammates from my FLL team, we formed a new team: The Clueless #11212. We figured that we could change the name later by being "The Less Clueless" and then "The Clueful", but we realize that we make so many trivial errors even to this day so we're still The Clueless.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, being the rookie season, we were especially lost in our fabrication techniques. We feared the drill press, ran anway from the blowtorch, and hid when the coach brought out the chop saw. This led to us frequently using tape and corrugated plastic on the robot.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these questionable techniques, our team still made it to the San Diego Regionals where we were the Winning Alliance, missing out on the Super Qualifier by only one place.
