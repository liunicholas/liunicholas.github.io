#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a regretable second year of FTC, our team really learned a lot. While we did learn more mechanical and software techniques, the greatest intangible we learned was teamwork. We learned how to cooperate, how to delegate, and how to make decisions and solve problems efficiently.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our thrid season of FTC, we hit the ground running with a new chassis made of Actobotics extrusions and Andymark mecanums. We built a solid robot that we were all very proud of, especially after the robot from our previous year. Our hard work this season paid off as we won the Inspire award in the San Diego region and went to the World Championship in Houston.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a great time there and had the chnace to meet teams from all around the world (also Texas BBQ is amazing). This season will be one of my most cherished memories from high school.
