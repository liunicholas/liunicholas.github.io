#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In STEM, women are severely underepresented which may come from a lack of opportunity at a young age. According to the Solow growth model, there are diminishing marginal returns on capital. Therefore, it is in society's best interests to be introducing STEM to young women who've never been exposed to the fields of robotics in their life in order to further the collective knowledge of humanity.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My robotics team, The Clueless #11212, partnered with [All Girls STEM Society](https://www.allgirlsstemsociety.org) to hold 2 hour sessions at a library to introduce coding, building, and testing robots to girls who've never played with them before. The events were highly successful with over 50 girls attending each time.
