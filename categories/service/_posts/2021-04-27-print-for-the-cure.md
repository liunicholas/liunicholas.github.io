#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the Shields Against COVID-19 project, we wanted to build a website that connected those who need PPE with volunteers around the nation who can make it. A friend and I were actually learning Django web development in our comp sci class so we were able to utilize that knowledge to code the site. Ultimately, over 100 makers registered on the platform, donating over 26,000 pieces of PPE to healthcare workers in 48 states.
