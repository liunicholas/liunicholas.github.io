#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The robotics season was canceled due to COVID-19, so my robotics team had many 3D printers laying around not printing anything. I saw online that while face masks required very high medical standards, face shields could be printed and utilized by hospitals.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set up a GoFundMe for the extra materials needed to create the face shields which raised almost $5,000 and raised an additional $4,000 from the ACCEF. Then, my team and I printed and assembled face shields that were sent to hospitals around San Diego. In the end, we donated over 3,000 face shields to more than 50 hospitals around the United States.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a sense of duty when working on this project because I knew that what I did during the pandemic would define me for the rest of my life. I didn't want to sit around playing Minecraft or watching anime at home; I wanted to produce something that could benefit society by protecting the frontline medical workers. In a way, this was my moral obligation.
