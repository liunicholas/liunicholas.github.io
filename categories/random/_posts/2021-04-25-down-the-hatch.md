#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family and I frequently travel to Hawaii during the winter break. I absolutely love the weather (even though it's almost the same in San Diego) and the beaches (which San Diego also has). Most importantly, the food there is amazing.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my most favorite restaurants there was Down The Hatch. The seared ahi tuna is to die for and the coconut shrimp is just completely unreal. This was also the first time I had fried chicken plus waffles and I fell in love.
