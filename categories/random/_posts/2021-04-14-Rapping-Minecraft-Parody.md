### In my freshmen year summer, I attended the COSMOS summer camp at UCSD. I formed some new friends there and we wanted to perform in the talent show for fun. None of us were extraordinarily "talented", so we played and a sung a Minecraft parody of the song ["Drowning" by Boogie Wit Da Hoodie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUtlqtdn1Xo) titled ["Mining" by Arrowind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMlLz7stjwc).

### The talent show was held in an auditorium of over 300 people. For an introverted person like me, this was probably one of my greatest steps in getting out of my comfort zone. Would I do this again though? Probably not.
