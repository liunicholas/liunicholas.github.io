#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my favorite hobbies in my free time is to design and print 3D models, or just to print files from Thingiverse when I see something cool that I want. My journey in 3D printing began in 2017 when I built my first printer: a Prusa mk2.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first few months of using it were an emotional rollercoaster; I spent hours trying to make it work, then breaking it, then crying myself to sleep when I couldn't fix it. At this time, 3D printing technoloy was not as prevalent as it is today so I should've heeded the warning that 3D printers weren't a commercial product.  
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I'm glad I went through it and fixed it. Half of the items on my desk are 3D printed to fit the minimalist aesthetic I'm going for.
