### Hi! I'm Nicholas Liu, your nerdy athletic Asian from San Diego.
<br>
### In my freshmen year of high school, I only had 2 weeks to essentially create a fully functioning browser arcade[^1] for the final project of the comp sci class. Fortunately, the teacher told my friend and I that comments would be optional so that we could finish in time. Unfortunately, when I went back to look at my code, I understand practically none of it.
<br>
### In order to avoid such a mishap with my own life memories, I decided to document as much of the relevant parts of my life as possible on this website. During this pandemic, I've frequently had existential crises on what I've ever done in life. This should help me remember.
<br>
### Additionally, for anyone looking to learn about me as a person, to read about my crazy comp sci projects, or to see me rap a minecraft song[^2], I urge them to explore my site :)
